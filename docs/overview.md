# Vite Task — Overview

Vite Task is the monorepo task runner built into vite+ (the `vp run` command). It orchestrates scripts across your workspace packages. Think of it as an alternative to Turborepo or Nx — but integrated directly into your vite+ workflow and designed around pnpm workspaces.

**Key capabilities:**

- **Dependency-aware execution** — tasks run in the correct order based on your `package.json` dependency graph and explicit `dependsOn` declarations.
- **Intelligent caching** — task outputs are cached automatically. When nothing changes, tasks complete in milliseconds by replaying cached output.
- **File system tracking** — instead of manually declaring inputs, Vite Task monitors which files each command actually reads and uses that information to determine cache validity.
- **Compound command caching** — multi-command scripts like `tsc && rollup` are split into sub-tasks, each cached independently.
- **Familiar CLI** — if you've used pnpm, the package selection flags and workflow feel right at home.

## Quick Example

Given a workspace:

```
my-app/
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml
├── package.json
├── packages/
│   ├── core/
│   │   ├── package.json        # @my/core
│   │   └── vite.config.ts
│   ├── lib/
│   │   ├── package.json        # @my/lib  →  depends on @my/core
│   │   └── vite.config.ts
│   └── app/
│       ├── package.json        # @my/app  →  depends on @my/lib
│       └── vite.config.ts
```

Each package has its own `vite.config.ts` that configures tasks for that package:

```ts
// packages/app/vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite-plus';

export default defineConfig({
  run: {
    tasks: {
      build: {
        command: 'tsc && rollup -c',
        dependsOn: ['lint'],
      },
      lint: {
        command: 'eslint src',
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Running `vp run -r build` executes across all packages in dependency order:

```
> vp run -r build
~/packages/core$ eslint src
...
~/packages/core$ tsc && rollup -c
...
~/packages/lib$ eslint src
...
~/packages/lib$ tsc && rollup -c
...
~/packages/app$ eslint src
...
~/packages/app$ tsc && rollup -c
...
---
[vp run] 0/6 cache hit (0%). (Run `vp run --last-details` for full details)
```

Run it again — everything is cached:

```
> vp run -r build
~/packages/core$ eslint src ✓ cache hit, replaying
~/packages/core$ tsc && rollup -c ✓ cache hit, replaying
~/packages/lib$ eslint src ✓ cache hit, replaying
...
---
[vp run] 6/6 cache hit (100%), 3.2s saved in total
```
